                <p>
                    Before beginning any projects, you first need to understand the context for existence - why are we doing this?
                    How is this contributing to the larger context, whether of a product, a company or the community that this is a part of?
                    What problems are we solving? What pain points are we trying to alleviate? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this phase, instead of trying to fit existing beliefs or visions of the project into action, understand the problem
                    from the users' perspectives. This can be done in a number of ways: direct observation, surveys, user interviews, market research, user analysis, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>Processes</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Define a product vision. </li>
                    <p> What problems are we solving? Why is it important that we solve this problem? </p>
                    <li> Conduct user research. </li>
                    <p> To fully emphathize with users, we need to conduct more than one type of user research. The focus is not on affirming the existing 
                        ideas we have in our head, but understanding the problem users go through thoroughly. </p>
                    <h3> Potential Methods: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> User Interviews </li>
                        <p>User intervies give rich information about the problems users are facing, not just the content but also the context, frequency
                            and so on. Instead of talking to users about your potential products, you need to extract data that will help you improve the 
                            product or improve your marketing or improve your positioning. In particular, talk about specifics that have already occurred 
                            in the user's life. 
                        </p>
                        <li> Surveys</li>
                        <p> Surveys enable us to get a larger volumes of responses, and give more quantitative answers that are easier to process. 
                            It is good to have clear, unbiased survey questions that are easy to understand. Keep the survey short by only including essential questions.
                        </p>
                        <li> Direct Observation</li>
                        <p> If there is already an existing product that needs improvement, it's good to observe users using the product directly. Ask users to 
                            do a few specific tasks, and observe how they go through the process - what are they doing? Are they doing what you expected? In addition,
                        collect quantitative data such as how easy is the task, how often do they carry out the task, etc. along with qualitative data (eg. Why do they choose this path?) </p>
                        <li> Market Research</li>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes, it's good to know what products are already available and how the new product will solve something that existing products do not.
                            To do so, look at the current landscape and identify strong competitors, both direct (very similar value proposition) and indirect 
                            (same customer base, even if the value proposition is different). For instance, a note-taking app might have a direct competitor like Notion or Evernote,
                            but also indirect competitors like Google Sheets, Google Docs, etc. Identify their strengths, weaknesses, key value propositions, and any other notes you might have.
                        </p>
                        <li>User Analysis</li>
                        <p>
                            From other research, we can synthesize key insights that might be useful for our application. From this, we can create representative persona - 
                            different hypothetical users that might use the product in a similar ways. This help us understand the users' goals in different contexts. 
                            However, it's important to ground the personas in data and research.
                        </p>

            <section class="main-section" id = "ideating">
                <header>Ideating</header>
                <p> From the insights we have collected, we can start brainstorming what different ways we can solve these problems. The goal is to be creative, but grounded in the problems.
                    After generating ideas, start discussing which ideas are more applicable than others, and start planning for them. Some processes that are useful would include journey mapping,
                    storyboarding, and writing user stories. 
                </p>
                <h2>Processes</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Brainstorm ideas. </li>
                    <p> Generate as many ideas as possible, try not to limit yourself to conventional ideas. In this process, do not just write features but also 
                        potential functions that the product needs to have, styles and design guidelines that would be useful, even user emotions and so on. It's useful, however,
                        to separate these different forms, for instance, using different post-it colors.
                    </p>
                    <li> Categorize ideas. </li>
                    <p> Start grouping ideas with similar goals together. In the process, evaluate whether there are methods that would be more effective than others. </p>
                    <li>Implement ideas into journey mapping. </li>
                    <p> Journey mapping is a visualization of a process that a person goes through to accomplish the goal. Since we already categorize the ideas into goals,
                        we can now put it into a series of steps and describe how the user would interact with the product. Create multiple journey maps that have simple, linear 
                        journey rather than complex ones. 
                    </p>
                    <li> (Optional) Storyboarding </li>
                    <p> We can further deepen the journey mapping by creating a strong narrative describing a day in the life of a persona, including 
                        how the product would fit in their life and how it would benefit them. However, this is not completely necessary. 
                    </p>
                    <li> User Stories </li>
                    <p> After journey mapping, simplify every function to a one-liner: When <em>insert situation</em> I want to <em>insert action</em> so that <em> insert outcome</em>. 
                        This helps designers focus on the most important actions & the related outcome.</p>

                <header>Planning</header>
                <p> A product can get complex very fast. Planning is incredibly important in managing this complexity, especially the interactions between different components. 
                    It is also helpful to start integrating low-fidelity sketching to start envisioning what the final user interface will look like.

                    <p> Information architecture is the organization of information within the products. This include both the potential screen,
                        but also the flows between different screens and how to make this as smooth and effortless as possible. This includes: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taxonomy and labeling</li>
                        <p> Start classifying items using categories, sections and tags. It's important to be consistent with the labels such that i
                            t's easy for both designers and users to communicate and understand one another.</p>
                        <li>Creating hierarchy and navigation</li>
                        <p> A typical sitemap is sufficient to visualize how different pages and content relate to one another. The hierarchy should show
                            two things: what the product structure is, and how the users will move through this structure. 
                        </p>

                    <p> Drawing by hand is a flexible and fast way to visualize the content of the product based on the information architecture. 
                        Designers can also play around with a broad range of solutions, content structures and designs that can also serve as a springboard for further development.</p>

                <header>Prototyping</header>
                <p>Prototyping does not just mean high-fidelity mock-ups, but creating atoms and components that are reusable and scalable, combining with wireframing to
                    represent the page structures and share ideas with other stakeholders. Then, prototypes can be created for further testing and understanding user interactions.
                    Here, it's important to understand not just the hierarchical structure, but also the color palette, typography, grids, visual elements, shapes and languages used in the final product.
                    Lastly, use tools like Figma to allow for team collaboration and direct translation to front-end CSS.

                    <p>Mid-fidelity wireframing is best created with a grayscale to avoid distraction from the content. Placeholder texts are expected - the important thing is showing 
                        the user flow and how the application will handle and show the different content.
                    </p>
                    <li>Creating and Updating Design System</li>
                    <p> From <a href = "https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/"> Atomic Design</a> by Brad Frost, we need to break the content down to its most basic elements i.e. atoms such as 
                    color, typography, icons, grid and spacing, and then combining them together to make molecules (i.e. buttons, search bar, etc.), then organisms (nav bar, header, footer, card, etc.), 
                    templates (our mid-fidelity prototypes) and finally pages. Thus, it's important to start early and document the different types of atoms and molecules in the process to ensure consistency. </p>

                <p> This is the most important part of the process - get your prototype to people you are designing for. Without their inputs,
                    you would not know if your product solves their problems, if there are major confusions and critical feedbacks you need to be aware of.
                    Remember to: test early, test often, test one-on-one, and fix the problems after every test. There's two type of testing:
                     
                </p>
                    <ul id="testing-ul">
                        <li> <strong>General testing:</strong> showing the user the site, see if they understand the purpose, organization, competitive advantages, etc. </li>
                        <lI> <strong>Key task testing:</strong> asking the user to do something specifically, then watching them do it.</lI>
                    </ul>
                <p> After getting feedback, improve your design straight away with users' feedback. Instead of trying to add more features, try to remove the difficult parts. 
                    The cleaner the design, the better. If there are critical problems, go back to the ideation stage to figure out new ways to solve these problems for users. 
                    Conduct these tests at least once a month, with three to four users each time. </p>
